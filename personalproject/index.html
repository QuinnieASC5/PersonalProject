        Being in Brookline is hard work. They don't just prepare you physically but mentally too. There are many jobs you can do there such as working at an Ice Cream shop and helping kids at the Rec.
        At Brookline there are many people and kids to meet. Kids run around this area like crazy and we host event over the summer too.
        At the park we do movie nights every Thursday. That's where you can really meet people if the same intrest as you.

        Brookline History really starts at our "The Cannon". It was given to us to show our cares for the veterans. The cannon sits on the small island situated between Brookline Boulevard, Queensboro and Chelton Avenues.
        But this cannon left it's spot July 8, 2017 and came back October. It was gone becuase a PAT bus had ran through the same park and taken the cannon with it. They restored it and given it a new code of paint. 
        The original cannon was a 4.7 inch Gun M1906 but later it became to old to be restored so we replaced it with the model 1917 Schneider 155mm Howitzer.
